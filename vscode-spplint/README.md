# vscode-spplint

This extension is a stub, only meant to supply very basic keyword/operator highlighting.  
Check out [vsc-extension-quickstart.md](./vsc-extension-quickstart.md) for the user manual.

This will be superseded by a proper S++ language server when it comes around.  
Until then, no publication of this extension will be made.
